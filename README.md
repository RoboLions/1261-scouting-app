# 1261 Scouting App
Repository for Python Flask Scouting Web Application for team 1261 <br>
Currently hosting off of http://scouting-app-1261.herokuapp.com/

Hello! This is the 1261 Scouting App, for use to gather data on teams during events and 
make decisions on who to bring onto our all-star alliance!

The application utilizes Flask, a python-based web service similar to Express.js which allows one to tie together HTML/CSS and send data back and forth between python and javascript. All of the data that the JS sends to the Python backend is stored in a MongoDB JSON Collecton. The app itself is hosted off a heroku, a free web-hosting service, but it may move to a private VPS server if that's the route our team decides to go.
